# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a web application that allows users to manage their daily schedule during standard business hours (9am-5pm). Users can add, edit, and save events for each hour, and the application dynamically updates the display to indicate whether each time block is in the past, present, or future.
